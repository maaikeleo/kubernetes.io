Netplan

Ubuntu 17.10 and later uses Netplan as the default network management tool. The previous Ubuntu versions were using ifconfig and its configuration file 
/etc/network/interfaces to configure the network.

Netplan configuration files are written in YAML syntax with a .yaml file extension. To configure a network interface with Netplan, you need to create a 
YAML description for the interface, and Netplan will generate the required configuration files for the chosen renderer tool.

Configuring Static IP address on Ubuntu Server

On Ubuntu 20.04, the system identifies network interfaces using ‘predictable network interface names’.

ip link

Netplan configuration files are stored in the /etc/netplan directory. You’ll probably find one or more YAML files in this directory. The name of the file may 
differ from setup to setup. Usually, the file is named either 01-netcfg.yaml, 50-cloud-init.yaml, or NN_interfaceName.yaml, but in your system it may be different.

01-netcfg.yaml
50-cloud-init.yaml
or 
NN_interfaceName.yaml


If your Ubuntu cloud instance is provisioned with cloud-init, you’ll need to disable it. To do so create the following file:

sudo nano /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg

network: {config: disabled}

To assign a static IP address on the network interface, open the YAML configuration file with your text editor :

sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    ens3:
      dhcp4: yes



network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    ens3:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses:
        - 192.168.121.221/24
      gateway4: 192.168.121.1
      nameservers:
          addresses: [8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1]

sudo netplan --debug apply
sudo netplan apply
sudo netplan apply

make sure restart the server
login once again caheck you got static IP.

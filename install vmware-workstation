Steps to Install Kubernetes on Ubuntu

Set up Docker

Step 1: Install Docker

Kubernetes requires an existing Docker installation. If you already have Docker installed, skip ahead to Step 2.

If you do not have Kubernetes, install it by following these steps:

1. Update the package list with the command:

sudo apt-get update

2. Next, install Docker with the command, as mentioned below URL

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

3. First Uninstall old versions

Older versions of Docker were called docker, docker.io, or docker-engine. If these are installed, uninstall them:

sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc

It’s OK if apt-get reports that none of these packages are installed.

The contents of /var/lib/docker/, including images, containers, volumes, and networks, are preserved. If you do not need to save your existing data, and want to start with a clean installation, 
refer to the uninstall Docker Engine section at the bottom of this page.

4. Install using the repository

Before you install Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker repository. Afterward, you can install and update Docker from the repository.

Set up the repository

Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install \
 ca-certificates \
 curl \
 gnupg \
 lsb-release
 
 Add Docker’s official GPG key:
 
  curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

Use the following command to set up the stable repository. To add the nightly or test repository, add the word nightly or test (or both) after the word stable in the commands below.

echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
  
 5. Install Docker Engine

 Update the apt package index, and install the latest version of Docker Engine and containerd, or go to the next step to install a specific version:
    
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

6. Check the installation (and version) by entering the following:

docker ––version

7.Verify that Docker Engine is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.

sudo docker run hello-world


8. Repeat the process on each server that will acts as master, workers

9. Start and Enable Docker

 9.1. Set Docker to launch at boot by entering the following:

sudo systemctl enable docker

9.2 Verify Docker is running:

sudo systemctl status docker

9.3 To start Docker if it’s not running:

sudo systemctl start docker

10. Repeat on all the other nodes.

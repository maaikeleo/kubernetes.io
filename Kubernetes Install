                                         Install Kubernetes

Update the apt package index and install packages needed to use the Kubernetes apt repository:
Verify the MAC address and product_uuid are unique for every node


You can get the MAC address of the network interfaces using the command ip link or ifconfig -a
The product_uuid can be checked by using the command sudo cat /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid

ifconfig -a
cat /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid

Check network adapters
If you have more than one network adapter, and your Kubernetes components are not reachable on the default route, we recommend you add IP route(s) so Kubernetes cluster addresses go via the appropriate adapter

Letting iptables see bridged traffic
Make sure that the br_netfilter module is loaded. This can be done by running lsmod | grep br_netfilter. To load it explicitly call sudo modprobe br_netfilter.

lsmod | grep br_netfilter
modprobe br_netfilter


Letting iptables see bridged traffic

Make sure that the br_netfilter module is loaded. This can be done by running lsmod | grep br_netfilter. To load it explicitly call sudo modprobe br_netfilter.

As a requirement for your Linux Node's iptables to correctly see bridged traffic, you should ensure net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables is set to 1 in your sysctl config, e.g.

cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/k8s.conf
br_netfilter
EOF

cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
EOF
sudo sysctl --system


Installing kubeadm, kubelet and kubectl

You will install these packages on all of your machines:

kubeadm: the command to bootstrap the cluster.
kubelet: the component that runs on all of the machines in your cluster and does things like starting pods and containers.
kubectl: the command line util to talk to your cluster.
Update the apt package index and install packages needed to use the Kubernetes apt repository:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl

Download the Google Cloud public signing key:
sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg

Add the Kubernetes apt repository:
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

Update apt package index, install kubelet, kubeadm and kubectl, and pin their version:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl

Allow the process to complete.

Verify the installation with:

kubeadm version

Repeat for each server node.
